# OpenCV-Selfie
This project is about taking selfies using python OpenCV and also store that selfie in Pics Folder. A History.txt file is also created where date-time, image_path and day is written for every image.

Make sure to create a folder names Pics in the same folder where your program is saved before executing the Program.

Selfie.py is the main file which clicks your selfie. You can also execute the same using the Jupyter Notebook names CV Selfie.ipynb
Happy Learning
