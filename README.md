# OpenCV Selfie
This project is about taking photos from the sytem's using python OpenCV and which can be stored a folder (here, 'Pics'). A History.txt file is also created where date-time, image_path and day is written for every image.

Note: The destination folder for the captured images (here, 'Pics') must be the same as the folder where the program is saved, for the productive execution of the Program.

Selfie.py is the main program which captures the image from the front camera. The same can be done in the Jupyter Notebook using CV Selfie.ipynb
